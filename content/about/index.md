On this day, 17 years ago, you were born.  28th April is one of our favorite days. Why? Because it was the day the world was lucky enough to have you in it.

You are funny. You are smart. You are sassy. You may be tough, but you have a heart of gold. You are loving and kind and genuine. Thank you for always being there when we need you. Thank you for being reliable. Thank you for being our partner in crime.

“And on those days when the sky begins to fall, you’re the blood of my blood. We can get through it all.” This lyric relates so much to us. It is so comforting knowing that no matter what happens in this crazy life, we will always have you by our side, just like you will have us by yours.


Happy birthday to you, little sister. 
We love you.
