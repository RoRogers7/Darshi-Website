A person who's been where you've been; someone you can call when things aren't going right; is more than just family; a sister is a forever friend.

You are so so cute Darshi. Meeting you always makes my day. I had so much fun that day when we went for dessets. I hope you had fun too. I always have you as my partner in crime and a little sister who will help me trouble Roro :D
You turn 17! Omg!!
Just rememeber,not everyone is nice, not everyone will like you. Always like yourself, always LOVE yourself. At times you'll feel like you need approval from other people, as if you can only fit in if they accept you. Don't let society or school change who you are. You're not meant to live just to blend in with everyone else. Be your unique self, add some flavor to the world! You're a breath of fresh air, your presence radiates such positivity to everyone around. I love you so much. You are loved by so many people, and I hope you always love yourself.
As a big sister(yep, I gave that post to myself, you have to accept it), I'm very protective over you. I will always stand up for you, always take your side, and always cheer you on. No matter what challenge you face, you will never have to do it alone. When you're sad, I'm sad for you. I'll do whatever it takes to see you smile again. Because when you're happy, everyone else around you is too. You're my little sister, and I love you so much. Keep your head up, remember your worth, and always strive to be the best you can be. I'm constantly proud of you and your decisions, and you should be proud too.
To my little sister, I sure do love you.
Happy Birthday Darshi ❤️ 
Lots of love,
Vrush.
