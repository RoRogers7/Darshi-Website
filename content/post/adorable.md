You are so cute and tiny. I want to protect you from everything. I love you.

Where to begin, I have no clue. Let me start by saying that you like the little sister I never had. I am so grateful that I came into Ro's life because now I am a part of your life too! I am so glad to be a part of the bond you two share.

Darshi, you are truly one of a kind. I am so proud of you. Knowing you for the past year has been unbeatably one of the best years going so far. Your spirt lifts me and everyone around you and thats what makes you, you! I have loved getting to know you and spending my time with you. You are so sweet and cute, I am just happy to be spending time with you.

You mean the world to me and definitely to your sadu brother, he doesn't stop talking about you and has all these stories to tell everytime after you guys meet. I am so so glad that I have someone so sweet in my life. You are so cute, I want to pack you in a box and keep you all to myself. 

I hope you know that you can tell me anything in the confidence that I won't tell anyone and I won't judge you. I will always be here to pick you up when you fall down and wipe the tears away from your eyes. I'm always willing to offer my advice, perspective, comfort, honesty and love. You can count on me.

Take care and keep shining always.

-Vrush
