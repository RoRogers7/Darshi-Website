Stop growing up. I wish you'd stay little forever. It's crazy to see the young women you've become, and you're constantly growing everyday. I am so proud of you for who you are, and love everything about you. When the world seems to turn its back to you, know that I will always be here.

I know growing up is hard. Life is hard, and I wish I could protect you from the cruelties of life forever. I wish I could deal with your trials instead, and let you live as happily as you did as a child. Yes, there are many scary things in life. There's also so much beauty and happiness. When things are tough, know they'll get better. I've been through heart breaks, friend losses, family problems school problems, and I'm still standing. Chances are, a lot of things you'll face, I have faced them too. Sure, I'm still growing as well, but I will always lend a helping hand when you need it. 


Happy Birthday Darshi ❤️ 

Lots of love,

Roro
