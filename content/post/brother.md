To the girl who will never understand how much she means to me. You are loved beyond imagination and worth more than you will ever understand.

My little sister is 17 now. But for me, you will always be my baby sister. Its so annoying when you don't listen to me when I tell you someone isn't right for you. Not that anyone could match the standards I set for someone you could be with. 

Just make sure you take care of yourself. Boys will be boys. Sometimes they'll make you feel important, and sometimes they won't. Don't let anyone treat you any less than you deserve- and you deserve the world. Boys should be polite, always gentlemen-like. If they break your heart, know that you don't have to stay broken. You will get over them. 

You will find someone someday who builds you up, not breaks you down. You're young, and have a whole life ahead of you, have fun. Don't let any person define your worth. You are worth more than any price, any kind of jewel, and no boy can take that away from you. Stand up for yourself. Don't let them walk over you. Remind yourself everyday that you are strong and important. Nobody, can take that away from you. Your heart will heal even when you feel like it won't. It's okay to be sad, it's okay to cry. You won't feel that way forever, get back up and try again. 

You're special and deserve everything. Seek out the best, because you deserve the best.
